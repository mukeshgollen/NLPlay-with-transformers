0,"In this research, we mainly consider the trajectory error correction problem of an UAV based on
system positioning accuracy constraints. Due to system structure limitations, the positioning system of such aircraft cannot accurately locate itself. Once the positioning error accumulates to a certain extent, the task may fail. Therefore, correcting the positioning error during flight is an important task in UAV trajectory planning. The trajectory planning problem of an UAV is a complex multi-constrained optimization problem. UAV trajectory planning refers to considering the positioning error during the flight due to a series of factors such as the environment and weather during the flight. Therefore, some safe positions are assumed in the flight area (called correction points) for safety correction. In order to enable a UAV to follow the original trajectory planning from the starting point to the ending point, several correction points are needed in the flight area to correct the trajectory error of an UAV.
Under the premise of many constraints, the correct point is selected to correct the error of a UAV, and the best flight path from the starting point to the ending point is planned for an UAV, so that the number of times a UAV is corrected by the correct points during the flight is as small as possible, and the trajectory length is as small as possible. How to ensure that a UAV meets the various constraints and the optimal trajectory requirements, and to quickly and accurately obtain the true flight trajectory is the problem that needs to be function. solved urgently. In the aircraft trajectory planning problem, the standard value through a pre-set cost planning problem is usually to establish a flight trajectory with the optimal cost function value through 2.2.

The dollar value of such corporate combinations doubled from the preceding year, exceeding two trillion dollars and reaching twenty percent of the gross national product. 1 Thus, an investigation of the law governing the devices used in the market for corporate control is particularly timely. But the economy, like history (or a washing machine; pick your metaphor), runs in cycles. When the high tide recedes, it will undoubtedly leave many businesses stranded on the beach, and bankruptcy filings will increase. The law governing bankruptcy practice is also ripe for consideration, or soon will be. Bankruptcy and mergers and acquisitions may seem quite distinct areas of corporate activity, but they raise some common questions. In particular, both demand that courts settle the appropriate treatment of lockups. The term ""lockup"" encompasses a variety of different devices sharing a common purpose. This Article will distinguish between different types of lockups where necessary, but the different types have similar effects and, for most of the analysis, an understanding of the purpose suffices. As a loose definition, a lockup is a device by which target management promises to compensate a bidder if the proposed merger falls through. Lockups may take a variety of forms: cash breakup fees which are paid to a would-be acquirer if another bid is ultimately accepted; options on treasury stock with an exercise price set near the bidder's offer price; or ""crown jewels"" options on a desirable portion of the target's assets.2 Such agreements obviously play an important role in contests for corporate control. They are, at least on the conventional understanding, a means by which target management can favor a particular bidder, increasing the odds that the target company will end up in the hands of a friendly, rather than a hostile, suitor. 
","In the desert outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a man wearing nothing but his underwear and a gas mask erratically drives an RV down a desolate highway. In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also wearing a gas mask. In the back of the RV are two bodies. After crashing the RV in a ditch, the drivers climbs out, dons a shirt handing from the side view mirror, and retrieves a video camera and gun from the vehicle. Recording a message on the camera, the man identifies himself as Walter White and bids a cryptic farewell to his wife and son as sirens are heard in the distance. Walt then walks onto the road and awaits the apparent approach of police, gun in hand.Three weeks earlier, on his 50th birthday, Walt wakes up before dawn and exercises while contemplating of a plaque on his wall commemorating his contributions to research that won a Nobel Prize. At breakfast, his pregnant wife, Skyler, hands him a plate of eggs topped by veggie bacon spelling out ""50"". They banter with their handicapped son, Walt Jr., who complains about the veggie bacon. Afterwards, Walt drops off Junior at J. P. Wynne High School, where Walt also works as a chemistry teacher.

1,"We propose a real-time method for odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 2-axis lidar moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation can cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps can be built by off-line batch methods, often
using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift and low-computational complexity with- out the need for high accuracy ranging or inertial measurements. The key idea in obtaining this level of performance is the division of the complex problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, by two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high frequency but low fidelity to estimate velocity of the lidar. Another algorithm runs at a frequency of an order of magnitude lower for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows the method to map in real-time. The method has been evaluated by a large set of experiments as well as on the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the method can achieve accuracy at the level of state of the art offline batch methods.
The method aims at motion estimation and mapping using a moving 2-axis lidar. Since the laser points are received at different times, distortion is present in the point cloud due to motion of the lidar (shown in the left lidar cloud). Our proposed method decomposes the problem by two algorithms running in parallel. An odometry algorithm estimates velocity of the lidar and
corrects distortion in the point cloud, then, a mapping algorithm matches and registers the point cloud to create a map. Combination of the two algorithms ensures feasibility of the problem to be solved in real-time.
","Corporate restructuring is the process of significantly changing a company's business model, management team or financial structure to address challenges and increase shareholder value. Restructuring may involve major layoffs or bankruptcy, though restructuring is usually designed to minimize the impact on employees, if possible. Restructuring may involve the company's sale or a merger with another company. Companies use restructuring as a business strategy to ensure their long-term viability. Shareholders or creditors might force a restructuring if they observe the company's current business strategies as insufficient to prevent a loss on their investments. The nature of these threats can vary, but common catalysts for restructuring involve a loss of market share, the reduction of profit margins or declines in the power of their corporate brand. Other motivators of restructuring include the inability to retain talented professionals and major changes to the marketplace that directly impact the corporation's business model. When we say corporate level it may mean a single company engaged in single activity or an enterprise engaged in multi activities. It could also mean a group having many companies engaged in related or unrelated activities. When such enterprises consider an exercise for restructuring their activities they have to take a wholesome view of the entire activities so as to introduce a scheme of restructuring at all levels. However such a scheme could be introduced and implemented in a phased manner. Corporate Restructuring also aims at improving the competitive position of an individual business and maximizing it's contribution to corporate objectives. It also aims at exploiting the strategic assets accumulated by a business i.e. natural monopolies, goodwill, exclusivity through licensing etc. to enhance the competitive advantages. Thus restructuring would help bringing an edge over competitors.
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.
The first MCU film is Iron Man (2008), which began the films of Phase One culminating in the crossover film The Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in the franchise are collectively known as ""The Infinity Saga"". The films of Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021).
Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu, and cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and a viral marketing campaign for the films featuring the faux news program WHIH Newsfront.
The franchise has been commercially successful and has generally received positive reviews. It has inspired other film and television studios to attempt to create similar shared universes with comic book character adaptations. The MCU has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.

2,"Neuro-degenerative disease is a common progressive nervous system disorder that leads
to serious clinical consequences. Gait rhythm dynamics analysis is essential for evaluating clinical states and improving quality of life for neuro-degenerative patients. The magnitude of stride-to-stride fluctuations and corresponding changes over time—gait dynamics—reflects the physiology of gait, in quantifying the pathologic alterations in the locomotor control system of health subjects and patients with neuro-degenerative diseases. Motivated by algebra topology theory, a topological data analysis-inspired nonlinear framework was adopted in the study of the gait dynamics. Meanwhile, the topological representation–persistence landscapes were used as input of classifiers in order to distinguish different neuro-degenerative disease type from healthy. In this work, stride-to-stride time series from healthy control (HC) subjects are compared with the gait dynamics from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease (HD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
The obtained results show that the proposed methodology discriminates healthy subjects from
subjects with other neuro-degenerative diseases with relatively high accuracy. In summary, our
study is the first attempt to provide a topological representation-based method into the disease
classification with gait rhythms measured from the stride intervals to visualize gait dynamics and
classify neuro-degenerative diseases. The proposed method could be potentially used in earlier
interventions and state monitoring
","The company pays dividends to its shareholders. Dividends are paid to distribute the profits made by the company during the year. Dividends are paid on a per-share basis. For example, during the financial year, 2012-13 Infosys had declared a dividend of Rs.42 per share. The dividend paid is also expressed as a percentage of the face value. In the above case, the face value of Infosys was Rs.5/- and the dividend paid was Rs.42/- hence the dividend payout is said to be 840% (42/5).It is not mandatory to pay out dividends every year. If the company feels that instead of paying dividends to shareholders, they are better off utilizing the same cash to fund a new project for a better future, they can do so.Besides, the dividends need not be paid from the profits alone. If the company has made a loss during the year, but it does hold a healthy cash reserve, then the company can still pay dividends from its cash reserves.Sometimes distributing the dividends may be the best way forward for the company. When the company’s growth opportunities have exhausted, and the company holds excess cash, it would make sense for the company to reward its shareholders, thereby repaying the trust the shareholders hold in the company.The decision to pay a dividend is taken in the Annual General Meeting (AGM) during which the directors of the company meet. The dividends are not paid right after the announcement. This is because the shares are traded throughout the year, and it would be difficult to identify who gets the dividend and who doesn’t. The following timeline would help you understand the dividend cycle.

","Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity.
Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.
Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, emotional depth, acting, and ambition. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design",is a progressive neuro-degenerative disease that leads to serious clinical consequences.

3,"the language of graph theory, or network sci-ence, has proven to be an exceptional tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use of networks
is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad – two nodes (neurons or brain regions) connected by an edge. While
rarely mentioned, this fundamental assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that graphs
can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that overcomes these limitations, thereby offer-
ing a broad range of new possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena. Specifically, we explore the use of simplicial complexes: a structure developed in
the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, of increasing applicability to real data due to a rapidly growing
computational toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding literature applying
simplicial complexes to neural data, from electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the
tools and recent ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries of
cognition The recent development of novel imaging techniques and he acquisition of massive collections of neural data make
finding new approaches to understanding neural structure a vital undertaking. Network science is rapidly becom-
ing an ubiquitous tool for understanding the structure of complex neural systems. Encoding relationships between objects of interest using graphs (Figs. 1a–b, 4a) enables the
use of a bevy of well-developed tools for structural characterization as well as inference of dynamic behavior. ","Firstly you need to know that, when you buy & sell (long trades) or sell & buy (short trades) stocks within a single trading day then such transactions are called intraday equity/stock trades. Alternatively, if you are buying stocks/equity and wait till it gets delivered to your DEMAT account before selling it, then it is called ‘equity delivery based’ transactions.
Taxes on long term capital gains for equity and mutual funds are discussed belowThe above taxation rate is only if the transactions (buy/sells) are executed on recognized stock exchanges where STT (Security transaction tax) is paid. As discussed above, LTCG is a holding period of more than 1 year If the transactions (buy/sells) are executed through off-market transfer where shares are transferred from one person to another via delivery instruction booklet and not via a recognized exchange by paying STT, then LTCG is 20% in case of both listed and non-listed stocks (Listed are those which trade on recognized exchanges). Do note that when you carry an off-market transaction Security Transaction Tax (STT) is not paid, but you end up paying higher capital gains tax.Note that a gift from a relative through DIS slip is not considered as a transaction and hence not capital gain.

His songs ""Silence"", ""Wolves"", ""Friends"", ""Happier"", and ""Alone"" have been certified multi-platinum in several countries and appeared in the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100.[a]
Marshmello first gained international recognition in early 2015 by publishing remixes online. His debut studio album, Joytime, was released in January 2016, which included the lead single and Marshmello's debut single ""Keep It Mello"". ""Alone"", a platinum-certified single was released in May 2016 via the Canadian record label Monstercat. Having peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 60, it became his first single to be certified platinum in the US and Canada with over 1 million copies of certified units.[a] That year, he released three subsequent singles. In 2017, after releasing singles such as ""Chasing Colors"", ""Twinbow"" and ""Moving On"", Marshmello collaborated with American R&B singer Khalid to release ""Silence"" as a single, which was certified platinum and multi-platinum in eight countries. Succeeding another single, one of his bestselling singles, a collaboration with American singer Selena Gomez, titled ""Wolves"" was released.
In 2018, he released ""Friends"", a collaboration with British singer Anne-Marie. Months later, his second studio album, Joytime II, was released with singles ""Tell Me"" and ""Check This Out"". ""Happier"", Marshmello's highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 and in the United Kingdom, a collaboration with British band Bastille, was released in August. In 2019, he earned $40 million, ranking 2nd on the list of highest paid DJs compiled by Forbes.[3]

4,"(Simplicial complex). Let V be a set. A k-simplex is a unordered set {v 0 , . . . , v k } with v i ∈ V and v i 6= v j . The faces of a k-simplex are all (k − 1)-simplices of the form {v 0 , . . . , v k } \
{v i }, which we will also denote by {v 0 , . . . , v i , . . . , v k }. A simplicial complex X is a collection of simplices closed under the inclusion of all faces, and we denote X d as the set of simplices strictly of dimension d. We denote by d max (X) the maximal dimension of all of the simplicesTwo d-simplices F 1 , F 2 of a complex X are called upper adjacent if both are faces of some d + 1-simplex; in this case, we write F 1  F 2 .Two d-simplices F 1 , F 2 of a complex X are called lower adjacent if they have a common face; in this case, we write F 1 ` F 2 .
Definition 2.2 (Ordered and weighted complexes). An order- ing of vertices gives an orientation, and an oriented k-simplex is  symmetric with respect to an exchange of vertices. We denote an
ordered simplex by square brackets, e.g., [v 0 , . . . , v k ]. Finally, we also allow for weighted simplices; for each simplex in the complex, we can attach a real number, known as the weight of the simplex. For a simplex F ∈ X, we denote the weight of F by w(F). We will assume throughout that all weights are positive. For X a simplicial complex, let C d (X) be the R -vector space with basis given by the elements of X d . For each d, we have the boundary map defined by and extended by linearity (as is well known, the map ∂ d ◦ ∂ d+1 is identically zero). The kernel of the map ∂ d : C d (X) → C d−1 (X) is known as the d-cycles of the complex X, and the image of ∂ d+1 : C d+1 (X) → C d (X) are called the d-boundaries. Since ∂ d ◦∂ d+1 = 0, it is natural to define the d-th homology group H d (X):= ker ∂ d /Im∂ d+1 .
","As mentioned earlier, one of the key assumptions in technical analysis is that we rely on the fact that history tends to repeats itself. This probably is one of the most important assumptions in Technical Analysis.
It would make sense to explore this assumption in greater detail at this juncture as candlestick patterns are heavily dependent on it.
Assume today, the 7th of July 2014 few things are happening in a particular stock. Let us call this factor:
Factor 1 – The stock has been falling for the last 4 consecutive trading sessions
Factor 2 –Today (7th July 2014) is the 5th session, and the stock is falling on relatively lower volumes
Factor 3 – The range in which the stock trades today is quite small compared to the last four days.
With these factors playing in the background, let us assume that on the next day (8th July 2014) the fall in stock gets arrested and the stock rallies towards a positive close. So, as an outcome of the 3 factors, the stock went up on the 6th day.
Time passes and let’s says after a few months, the same set of factors is observed for 5 consecutive trading sessions. What would you expect for the 6th day?
According to the assumption – History tends to repeat itself. However, we need to make an addendum to this assumption. When a set of factors that have panned out in the past tends to repeat itself in the future, we expect the same outcome to occur, as was observed in the past, provided the factors are the same.
Therefore, based on this assumption, we can expect the stock price to go up on the 6th trading session even this time around.

","Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' (from her mother's maiden name) and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.
Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's Bad. Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo. 2017's electropop Witness featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album Smile followed in 2020.
Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018.","Let v i  V Let k. (System complex).

5,"Although there has been a lot of work in the last fifteen years (see [1, 2] for recent reviews), I think it would be fair to say that we do not yet have a fully satisfactory and consistent quantum theory of gravity. At the moment classical General Relativity still provides the most successful description of gravity. In classical General Relativity one has a classical metric which obeys the Einstein equations, the right hand side of which is supposed to be the energy momentum tensor of the classical matter fields. However, although it may be reasonable to ignore quantum gravitational effects on the grounds that these are likely to be small, we know that quantum mechanics plays a vital role in the behaviour of the matter fields. One therefore has the problem of defining a consistent scheme in which the space-time metric is treated classically but is coupled to the matter fields which are treated quantum mechanically. Presumably such a scheme would be only an approximation to a deeper theory (still to be found) in which spacetime itself was quantized. However one would hope that it would be a very good approximation for most purposes except near space-time singularities. The approximation I shall use in this paper is that the matter fields, such as scalar, electro-magnetic, or neutrino fields, obey the usual wave equations with the Minkowski metric replaced by a classical space-time metric gab. This metric satisfies the Einstein equations where the source on the right hand side is taken to be the expectation value of some suitably defined energy momentum operator for the matter fields. In this theory of quantum mechanics in curved space-time there is a problem in interpreting the field operators in terms of annihilation and creation operators. In flat space-time the standard procedure is to decompose 200 S. W. Hawking the field into positive and negative frequency components
","Dow Theory suggests the markets are made up of three distinct phases, which are self-repeating. These are called the Accumulation phase, the Markup phase, and the Distribution phase.
The Accumulation phase usually occurs right after a steep sell-off in the market. The steep sell-off in the markets would have frustrated many market participants, losing hope of any uptrend in prices. The stock prices would have plummeted to rock bottom valuations, but the buyers would still be hesitant to buy fearing another sell-off. Hence the stock price languishes at low levels. This is when the ‘Smart Money’ enters the market.
Smart money is usually the institutional investors who invest in a long term perspective. They invariably seek value investments which are available after a steep sell-off. Institutional investors start to acquire shares regularly, in large quantities over an extended period of time. This is what makes up an accumulation phase. This also means that the sellers trying to sell during the accumulation phase will easily find buyers, and therefore the prices do not decline further. Hence invariably, the accumulation phase marks the bottom of the markets. More often than not, this is how the support levels are created. Accumulation phase can last up to several months.
Once the institutional investors (smart money) absorb all the available stocks, short term traders since the support. This usually coincides with the improved business sentiment. These factors tend to take the stock price higher. This is called the markup phase. During the Markup phase, the stock price rallies quickly and sharply. The most important feature of the markup phase is speed. Because the rally is quick, the public at large is left out of the rally. New investors are mesmerized by the return, and everyone from the analysts to the public sees higher levels ahead.

6,"We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from ransformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both
left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute mprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ google-research/bert. We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.","We are all living in a very uncertain and unprecedented time. Covid 2nd wave has been brutally devastating and has caused a lot of pain and misery to humanity. I hope you are your family are staying safe. Please double mask if you really have to step out. I hope humanity does not have to face this situation ever again, and we get out of this situation as quickly as possible.Let me start this module on Financial Modelling with an apology. I know this module was due for a while now. I know, I’ve taken a lot of time to get started on this. There were multiple reasons for the delay, but that’s all behind now. Here we are, all set. I’m super excited to deliver this module, and I hope you are excited  But there are a few things to note before we get started –
Financial modelling as a subject is taught either in the classroom or in a  video format. There is a reason for this – while teaching this subject, at any given point, we tend to open up multiple threads and then tie it all together in the end. So in a sense, there are hops, jumps, crisscrossing, and a bit of number juggling. Given the nature of this subject, it makes sense to teach this online or via a physical classroom setup.
Think of it as producing a movie. I’m sure you understand that a movie is not shot scene after scene in a sequential manner. Different scenes are shot, songs are recorded, action scenes are shot, edited, and then patched together and eventually made to look like the entire movie was show scene after scene.

","Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, the series follows the exploits of the Shelby crime family in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional family is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the same name, who were active in the city from the 1890s to the early 20th century.
Peaky Blinders features an ensemble cast, led by Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, and Paul Anderson starring as Tommy Shelby, Elizabeth ""Polly"" Gray, and Arthur Shelby, respectively, the gang's senior members. Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Paddy Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen, Charlotte Riley, Sam Claflin, and Anya Taylor-Joy also have recurring roles at various times of the series. The show premiered on 12 September 2013, telecast on BBC Two until the fourth series, and then shifted to BBC One for the fifth and upcoming sixth series.
In 2018,[2] after the show's Drama Series win at the BAFTA TV Awards, Knight confirmed his ""ambition of making it a story of a family between two wars, and by ending it with the first air raid siren in Birmingham"", which was 25 June 1940.[3] The fifth series premiered on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and finished on 22 September 2019. Netflix, under the deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, had acquired the rights to release Peaky Blinders in the United States and around the world. In January 2021, the sixth season was announced to be the final season of the series.","a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations fro Differential Languages, for which we introduced a new language representation model called TERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Languages and Communities fro Differential Languages (BERT).
