## Week 1 :
Introduced us  to the field of Natural Language Processeing and looked at the  advancements in the past decade in the field.Also looked at the vast application of this field to many areas like speech recognition, sentiment analysis,voice assistants and many more uncountable applications.

**Basic- text Preprocessing**:
Explored various features of ```nltk```  a python library for basic text preprocessing like tokenization, stemming,lemmatization , removal of stop words , removal of punctuation etc 

## Week 2:
Got familiar with the domain of Deep NLP and looked at many advancements in the Deep NLP.Nextly looked at the many techniques of Word Embedding like :
Frequency based ,count vectors, TF-TDF, Co -Occurence matrix ,Skip-gram model and Prediction based Vector.

Finally trained a Sentiment Classifier on the dataset ```IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset``` in which pre processing is done with the  help of ```nltk``` and the Bag of Words is used for vector genreation and a Feed forward neural network is trained in ```PyTorch```
